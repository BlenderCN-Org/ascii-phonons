Visualisation of crystal vibrations with Blender.

Visualisation is a powerful tool for the study of vibrations in the solid state.
"Semi-automatic" animations have been generated for scientific publications, where they provide insight to spectroscopic observations.\[[1][Skelton2015],[2][Brivio2015]\] (Images [1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4917044.1), [2](http://people.bath.ac.uk/aw558/temp/mapi_phonon.gif).) In order to make this type of imagery more accessible, and add some visual interest to [ajjackson](https://github.com/ajjackson)'s PhD thesis, a more convenient and automatic toolchain is desirable.


## Development

This is still very rough and ready. "Old code" is some legacy code from the "semi-automatic" process. This code depends on [Clemens Barth's XYZ file importer](http://development.root-1.de/Atomic_Blender_XYZ.php).

The target for input files is the ASCII format used by [v_sim](http://inac.cea.fr/L_Sim/V_Sim/), a useful program and currently one of the only tools available for visualising phonons. These files contain all the information needed to define a crystal sructure and its vibrations. It is presumed that these are generated by [Phonopy](http://phonopy.sourceforge.net/) from *ab initio* electronic structure calculations, and initially this code will only target the features used by Phonopy. Extension to the full ASCII format is of course welcome.
Animation and rendering will be done in [Blender](http://www.blender.org/).
The preferred approach to Blender is to write an "add-on" which carries out importing duties.
Developing Blender add-ons can be a bit clunky as one is required to mess around with the GUI when testing changes, so there may be some hackery to get around this.

The target platforms are modern GNU/Linux distributions and Mac OS X. Windows support is seen as faintly desirable, but would impede the initial development process.
