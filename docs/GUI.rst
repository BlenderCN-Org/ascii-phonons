Graphical user interface
========================

A simple graphical user interface (GUI) is available, including a "preview" window.
At this time a useful subset of features is implemented.

To launch the GUI, which is compatible with Python 3 and recent
version of Python 2, simply run **scripts/gui.py**.

Dependencies
------------

- Tkinter is used to draw the GUI. This is included in standard Python distributions.

- The "PIL" module is loaded to handle the preview rendering. This dependency is best satisfied by installing "Pillow".
