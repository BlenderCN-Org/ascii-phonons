Introduction
============

**ascii-phonons** is a package to produce attractive images and animations of phonon modes in crystals.

Visualisation is a powerful tool for the study of vibrations in the solid state.
"Semi-automatic" animations have been generated for scientific publications, where they provide insight to spectroscopic observations. [1]_, [2]_ In order to make this type of imagery more accessible, and add some visual interest to `ajjackson <https://github.com/ajjackson>`_'s PhD thesis, a more convenient and automatic toolchain has been developed.

Images are rendered using the open-source 3D animation package `Blender <http://www.blender.org>`_.
As Blender has a notoriously steep learning curve, a :ref:`cli` is provided which may be used to generate images without interacting with the Blender interface.
It is intended that a simple :ref:`gui` will also be made available.
