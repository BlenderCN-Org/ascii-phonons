Development
===========

Development is in progress and hosted on `Github <https://github.com/ajjackson/ascii-phonons>`_.
Please use the `issue tracker <https://github.com/ajjackson/ascii-phonons/issues>`__ for
feature requests, bug reports and more general questions.

The target for input files is the ASCII format used by
`v\_sim <http://inac.cea.fr/L_Sim/V_Sim/>`__, a useful program and
currently one of the only tools available for visualising phonons. These
files contain all the information needed to define a crystal sructure
and its vibrations. It is presumed that these are generated by
`Phonopy <http://phonopy.sourceforge.net/>`__ from *ab initio*
electronic structure calculations, and initially this code will only
target the features used by Phonopy. Extension to the full ASCII format
is of course welcome.

Animation and rendering is done in `Blender
<http://www.blender.org/>`__.  The preferred approach to scripting
Blender is to write an "addon" which carries out importing duties.
However, the target user for ascii-phonons is not familiar with Blender's
interface and should not need to learn it. A traditional Blender
addon, accessed throught the Blender GUI, is therefore inappropriate.
In theory Blender can be built as a Python library but this appears to
be quite difficult and would create a high barrier to use.
Instead, ascii-phonons works by creating an addon library for Blender,
creating a temporary script file which uses this library and calling Blender as
a subprocess.

The initial target platforms are modern GNU/Linux distributions and Mac OS X. 
Operation under Windows is not actively being tested, but is desirable.
